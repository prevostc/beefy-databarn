-- Materialized intermediate: Unified hourly stats from all sources
-- Uses UNION ALL + CoalescingMergeTree instead of GROUP BY for better performance
-- CoalescingMergeTree automatically merges rows with the same sorting key,
-- retaining the latest non-NULL values for each column during background merges
-- This avoids the memory-intensive GROUP BY aggregation
