-- Mart model: Daily aggregation of revenue, yield, and BIFI buyback metrics (last 30 days)
-- This model provides daily totals for:
-- - revenue_usd: Total revenue from BIFI buybacks and feebatch harvests (treasury amounts)
-- - yield_usd: Total yield from harvest events
-- - bifi_buyback_usd: Total BIFI buyback amount in USD
-- Limited to the last 30 days for performance
-- Built directly from staging models without relying on other marts
